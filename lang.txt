This query language will support CRUD operations and 
implementation of the following keywords & operators:

-------------------------Operators------------------------------------
= != < <= > >= 


------------------------------READ Keywords-------------------------------
select
from
where

examples include:

select * from users;
select name from users where age >= 18;

also be able to handle:
select name from users where age >= 10 + 5 + 3;

above example still adds up to 18, and is a valid SQL command

------------------------------CREATE & UPDATE Keywords-------------------------------
insert
values

update
set

------------------------------Delete Keywords-------------------------------

delete
drop table


------------------------------Next Steps-------------------------------

Phase II of this project will be to implement more complex things 
like nested queries, group by, joins, aggregate functions, having, 
and moving DB from memory to being on disk & leverage B/B+ trees, but
this is for way down the line
